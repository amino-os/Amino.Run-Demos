## Local deployment

### Add Android Properties
```shell
This can be done in two ways:

1. Through IDE:
    Import the gradle project in the Android Studio and the IDE itself adds a local.properties file
    in your project structure with the path to your sdk defined.

Alternatively,

2. From the command prompt:
    $ cd Amino.Run-Demos/minnieTwitter/
    > cat >> local.properties  << EOF
    ndk.dir=<your ndk dir>
    sdk.dir=<your sdk dir>
    EOF
```

### Generate keystores for signing Android apps
```
$ cd Amino.Run-Demos/minnieTwitter/
$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -storepass xxxxxx -alias xxxxxx -keypass xxxxxx -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```
### Building the App
```
$ cd Amino.Run-Demos/
$ ./gradlew build
```
### Environment Setup
1. Replace the below ip addresses and ports with that of oms and kernelServers respectively:

    File path: Amino.Run-Demos/**gradle.properties**
    ```
    omsIp = 127.0.0.1
    kernelServer1Ip = 127.0.0.1
    omsPort=22346
    kernelServer1Port=22345
    ```

2.  Replace the first and second argument passed to the **hostAddress** with the ```omsIp``` and ```omsPort``` respectively:

    File path: Amino.Run-Demos/minnieTwitter/src/main/java/amino/run/appexamples/minnietwitter/glue/**Configuration.java**
    ```
    public static String [] hostAddress = { "127.0.0.1", "22346", "10.0.2.15", "22345" };
    ```
    The third and fourth argument above in the hostAddress are your device kernelServer ip and port respectively.

### Run OMS

$ cd Amino.Run-Demos/
$ ./gradlew minnieTwitter:subprojects:runoms
```
### Run KernelServer

$ cd Amino.Run-Demos/
$ ./gradlew minnieTwitter:subprojects:runks
